# Arduino Handbook

in setup

pinMode(<PIN NUMBER>, <SETTING>)
<SETTING> is INPUT or OUTPUT

photo resistor -> converts some light into electrical, reducing resistance
-> non polar


digital pins vs analog pins
digitial is only on or off
analog can be a range


voltage divide to make readings, almost always

voltage divide by doing 5V - component - * - 10 k resitor - ground, * is where u take input
